I made this app so that I could set a timer to let my computer go to sleep. This way I can just put on a video and let it play while the computer will shut it off after a certain amount of time.
This probably already exists....
But oh well good learning of QT.
Currently trying to figure out why pyinstaller exe won't load since it loads in IDLE but who knows maybe ill fix it one day.
